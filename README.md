# Lightweight-Adaptive-Tutor-LAT-System
The Lightweight Adaptive Tutor (LAT) implements a Q-Learning agent that selects optimal question difficulties in real-time, creating personalized learning paths. The system simulates student-tutor interactions and benchmarks the RL agent against rule-based baseline strategies to demonstrate improved learning efficiency.
